      Although real estate is often considered to be a profitable investment tool, it provides peopleâ€™s basic housing
      needs and hence, has substantial implications for society. Ethical values and practices in real estate business
      are important for the stakeholders such as investors, real estate agents, real estate appraisers, financial
      institutions, and government bodies who are involved in real estate transactions. In order to build a respectful
      environment, market players of real estate business should embed the principles of corporate social responsibility
      (CSR) into their operations. <br />
      <br />
      There is a growing awareness of the principles of CSR in the financial markets around the globe; in particular in
      the real estate market due to occasional financial crises.
